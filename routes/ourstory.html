      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <h3>Just a couple college kids and their small but mighty air fryer.</h3>
      <p>It all started on a typical wednesday night as two Duke sophomores stressed about homework assignments and upcoming exams. While taking a study break to munch on some tasty air fried rotisserie chicken for dinner, a great idea came to life... what if we turned this heavenly chicken into a business! College students are so busy already, no one wants to have to stress about what they are going to eat for each meal. That's where ChicKaina comes to save the day. With our service, students simply order chicken from us and we deliver a whole nutritious meal to them at whatever time is most convenient to them. And with a warm, crispy chicken and some tasty rice, we started bringing smiles to our customers faces.</p>
